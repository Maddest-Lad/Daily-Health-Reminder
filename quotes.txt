My patience isn't limitless... unlike my authority
Those who are made can be unmade
I am The Alien From Another Dimension. Your world screams out for my domination! And if you get in my wayâ€¦I will sweep you and your insignificant species aside!
You have one sentence to convince me not to kill you all
I swear by all the salt in me: if you run counter to my desire, the remainder of your brief mortal span will be an orchestra of misery.
Might as well stop breathing, you're not going to be doing that anymore.
They would have to glue you back together, IN HELL !!!!!
Spoiler alert- I'm about to kick your ass
Your tuition just went up 1000$
